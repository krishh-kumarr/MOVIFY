## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **OMDb API**

### Backend (ML – Prototype)
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**

## 🧠 Machine Learning Recommendation Backend (Prototype)

### 🔍 Overview
Movify includes a **local ML-based recommendation system** designed to provide **personalized movie suggestions** based on user preferences and movie metadata.

⚠️ **Note:**  
The ML backend is **not deployed publicly** and is intended for **local execution and experimentation**.

### 🧪 Recommendation Techniques Used

#### 1️⃣ Content-Based Filtering
- Recommends movies similar to those the user already likes
- Uses features such as:
  - Genre
  - Plot keywords
  - Movie metadata
- Ideal for **new users (cold-start problem)**

**Example:**  
If a user likes sci-fi movies such as *Inception*, the system recommends similar sci-fi titles.

---

#### 2️⃣ Collaborative Filtering (Prototype)
- Identifies users with similar preferences
- Recommends movies liked by similar users
- Uses similarity measures like **cosine similarity**

**Example:**  
If two users like similar movies, recommendations are shared across them.

---
The ML system is intentionally kept **local** because:
- The focus is on **algorithm correctness and experimentation**
- Avoids premature cloud deployment and API costs
- Allows faster iteration and model tuning
- Designed as a **research and learning component**

The backend can be easily integrated and deployed once the model is production-ready.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integrate ML backend with frontend via REST APIs
- Hybrid recommendation system (Content + Collaborative)
- User profiles and persistent preferences
- Cloud deployment using Docker and managed ML services
- Authentication and personalized dashboards

## 🧠 Interview-Ready Explanation

> “The frontend is fully deployed and production-ready.  
> The ML recommendation backend is a local prototype focused on experimentation and model quality, designed to be deployed once stabilized.”
